# Delisoba Deluxe English Translation Patch
An English patch for the Sega Saturn Japanese exclusive, <a href=https://segaretro.org/Delisoba_Deluxe>Delisoba Deluxe.

The game is known as the rarest Sega Saturn game as it was (apparently) only given out to either contestants and/or audience members of the Japanese game show "Tokyo Friend Park 2." The game sees you racing through the streets of Japan, attempting to deliver soba to the TBS HQ in record time, all while dodging traffic, construction, and a giant gorilla tossing bananas.

With this small translation, that means I've brought the two rarest Saturn games to English. **Heey-yo!** Feels good.

## **Overview**
This patch was created to continuing growing my Saturn romhacking skills, as well as serve as nice distraction from a couple other projects I'm cooking up. To that end, the following changes have been implemented:

- Title screen redrawn
- New English font tiles
- Options menu translated
- Pause menu translated
- All map editor elements translated
